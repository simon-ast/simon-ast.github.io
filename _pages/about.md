I am a PhD student and University Assistant at the University of Vienna.
My research focusses on the observation and characterisation of 
<a href='https://exoatmospheres.univie.ac.at/'>exoplanetary atmospheres</a>. 
I perform end-to-end data reduction on observations taken by the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), and atmospheric retrievals based on 
Bayesian inference.

I currently work on the atmospheres of hot Jupiters and sub-Neptunes, 
but my research interests also include the co-evolution of star-planet systems, 
interactions between host stars and their planets, and planetary habitability.
